== DESCRIPTION:

Web site of Macedonian Ruby Users Group (MKRUG)

The idea of ruby.mk is to build a simple website using Sinatra
http://www.sinatrarb.com/ ruby framework. Functionality of the site
should be very basic, with features for posting announcements and
aggregation of contents from other sites (twitter, blogs, bookmarks,
etc) of MK ruby users. Any other ideas are also welcome and will be
discussed. If you are interested in collaboration on this project 
please write a private message and we will add you as a collaborator. 
Then you can clone the repository and add your name in the License 
copyright area and commit to check if everything works OK.


== INSTALLATION

- Install sinatra and sinatra-authorization gems as submodules

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

- Install Data Mapper gems and database support

    sudo gem install dm-core
    sudo gem install dm-more

    sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev # dependency for do_sqlite3
    sudo gem install do_sqlite3 # data objects driver for SQLite3
    sudo gem install do_mysql # data objects driver for MySQL

- Setup database

This project now uses database-yml plugin.

First make sure the database is correctly set and created.
If you are using MySQL, you should first create database.

    mysql -u root -p # login to mysql console
    CREATE DATABASE ruby_mk CHARACTER SET = utf8 # create ruby_mk database
    
Then, create a config/database.yml. It should look something like this:

    development:
      adapter: sqlite3
      database: db/ruby_mk_devel.sqlite3

    test:
      adapter: sqlite3
      database: db/ruby_mk_test.sqlite3

    production:
      adapter: mysql
      host: localhost
      database: ruby_mk
      username: ruby_mk
      password: ruby_mk

- Config application

    cp config/app.yml.temp config/app.yml # copy and then edit app.yml with your credentials

- Run application with thin server

    thin start --rackup config.ru # run app with thin server
    rackup config.ru -p 3000 # or with rackup
